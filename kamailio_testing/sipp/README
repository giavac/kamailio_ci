Build image with:

docker build -t USER/sipp .

Run with:

docker run -i -t -v $PWD/scenarios/:/root/sipp/ --name=sipp --net=http_network USER/sipp /bin/bash

In that example the container is attached to a docker network: http_network.

Edit msg.xml with the IP address or name of nginx container.
Edit run_sipp.sh with the IP address(es) of kamailio containers under test.
